A digital library management system is a sophisticated software application designed to organize, store, manage, and provide access to a vast collection of digital resources. It serves as a comprehensive platform that replaces or supplements traditional library functions, leveraging digital technology to offer efficient cataloging, retrieval, and dissemination of information.

The primary goal of a digital library management system is to streamline the process of managing diverse digital content such as e-books, scholarly articles, audiovisual materials, research papers, databases, and more. It allows users, whether librarians or patrons, to easily search, access, and retrieve information remotely from anywhere with an internet connection.
